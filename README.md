# HappyTree
Happy Tree is a simple xamarin app for android, which I made by the request of my dad. Also it was a great way to learn some android app making technology.

It is a simple game where you click apples to gain score, but you have to look out for the brown ones, as they are game over.

The game isn't optimized very much, also I could say Xamarin is one of the worst technologies to make a game like that, but I wanted to train a little and learn things that are more universal.
